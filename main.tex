    % ABSTRACT

\begin{abstract}
Acoustic emission (AE) monitoring is a non-destructive evaluation technique widely used to detect and analyse the acoustic waves generated by material deformation and damage. In this study, we applied AE monitoring to laser shock peening (LSP). We conducted LSP experiments on AA2024 samples and simultaneously recorded the AE signals generated during the process. The AE signals were analysed to identify the acoustic event of laser-induced breakdown in water. The results show that AE monitoring can provide valuable information on the LSP process and its effects on the material properties. Furthermore, the AE signals can be used to optimise the LSP parameters, such as the laser energy and spot size, to achieve the desired compressive residual stresses and avoid undesired damage. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of AE monitoring as a tool for the in-situ characterisation of LSP, providing insights into the underlying physical processes and helping to improve the quality and reliability of the treated materials.
